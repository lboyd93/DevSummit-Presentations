_CoAuthored with [Hugo Campos](https://github.com/hccampos) and [Rene Rubalcava](https://github.com/odoe)_

![Programming Patterns Title Slide](/2022/images/ProgrammingPatterns.jpg)

In this session, you'll learn the basics of the ArcGIS API for JavaScript, including the fundamentals of watching for property changes, autocasting, working with collections, and lazy-loading data in your applications. You'll learn more details about maps, webmaps, layers, 2D and 3D views, UI, and widgets. This is a key session for developers new to the 4.x version of the API.

GeoJSON, CSV, and OGC data can easily be brought in as layers with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript. In this demo theater, we will build an application that will take advantage of the many capabilities of these layer types.
