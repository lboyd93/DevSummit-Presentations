_CoAuthored with Lauren Ballantyne_

![Data From Anywhere Title Slide](/2023/images/BetterUXPopups.png)

In this session, you’ll learn how to utilize recently added features in the Map Viewer and the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript that allow you to modify the popup’s appearance and behavior. We’ll cover how to configure different elements within the pop-up, work with Arcade, display charts, and more to modify the look and feel the of the popup to meet your application’s requirements.

### ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript: Programming Patterns and API Fundamentals
_CoAuthored with [Sage Wall](https://github.com/sagewall)_

![Programming Patterns Title Slide](/2023/images/ProgrammingPatterns.jpg)

In this session, you'll learn the basics of the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript, including the fundamentals of watching for property changes, autocasting, working with collections, and lazy-loading data in your applications. You'll learn more details about maps, webmaps, layers, 2D and 3D views, UI, and widgets. This is a key session for developers new to the 4.x version of the API.

GeoJSON, CSV, GeoTIFF, and OGC data can easily be brought in as layers with the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript. In this demo theater, we will build an application that will take advantage of the many capabilities of these layer types.
